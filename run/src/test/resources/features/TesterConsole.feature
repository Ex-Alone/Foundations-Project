    Scenario: As a tester I want to address this problem in linear progression

        When    the tester waits for webpage to load
        When    the tester selects a defect level of priority first
        When    the tester updates a defect status to accept first
        When    the tester clicks on button to apply changes first
        When    the tester selects a defect level of priority second
        When    the tester updates a defect status to accept second
        When    the tester clicks on button to apply changes second
        When    the tester selects a defect level of priority third
        When    the tester updates a defect status to accept third
        When    the tester clicks on button to apply changes third
        When    the tester selects a defect level of priority fourth
        When    the tester updates a defect status to accept fourth
